<p>First of all - <strong>Welcome </strong>to our blog. Here you'll be the first to get bleeding edge news about Newtry. At it's core Newtry is a shopping assistant. Boring. But is it? "Why would I need a shopping assistant and how does it improve my life?" - cool that you ask, let me take you on a journey to show you how...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:more -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Idea</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newtry helps you to check a product's ingredients and nutritional values on the fly by simply scanning its barcode. This enables you to know every last detail of the food you're eating in an easy and enjoyable way. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it's not only about you, it's about all of us! Newtry will help you to check a product's climate impact. This way <strong>you</strong> can contribute towards a better tomorrow just by taking your smartphone with you on a shopping spree! And just between us two - who doesn't already have it at hand while shopping? 😉</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We want to enhance the feeling of unity even further by implementing a community feature in the future. This will add a function which will allow users to share their opinion on a product after buying it. Users will be able to see what other people like or dislike about their products. But for the scope of the Software Engineering class this project began seeing the light of the world, we'll keep this feature as our special weapon a bit further down the line in the backlog.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Technology</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regarding our tech stack we're sticking with a typical split into front- and backend.  In the frontend our focus will be on React Native. We're going to use Redux for data-management throughout the application, Jest for testing and react-native-i18n for internationalization. The frontend will be connected to the backend via Firebase SDK. That said, unsurprisingly the backend is going to be made with Firebase. This way we're keeping the overhead small (KISS - remember?) and integrate Cloud Technology in our application. We're also going to use default programming tools like GitHub as a VCS and YouTrack for project management. We'll also use a SCRUM workflow with weekly syncs.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Stay tuned for more about our journey to a better world. Farewell and see you soon!</p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi there!
we would like to give you some feedback about your first blogpost. There are several things we liked: 

- You have a clear vision of how your app can impact your health positively. 
- The motivation for using product is becoming pretty clear to the reader. That's a pretty good thing.
- We like the idea of implementing a community feature that enables people to share their opinion on products
- Your writing style is pretty good!
 
However, we think that there are some things that can be improved: 
improvable:
- There is a typo in the last paragraph: fronted
- We would appreciate it if you could add some sub headers to your paragraphs for better readability
- We would be interested in the methods to determine the environmental impact of a product. Maybe you could elaborate on this in one of you future blog posts.

Nevertheless, in general it's a good first blog post!

Sincerely,
Group Receita]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I enjoyed reading your blog – I feel like you are ready to invest time in the project and am looking forward to any updates 🙂 .

Are you plan on make newtry accesible through the browser too?

I really like that you already know exactly what you want to do as a project, which technologies you want to use and how you want to organise yourself. You're on a good route.

I cant really find any point where you could improve your project, exept that you could include sub headers to your paragraphs for better readability and orientation.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello Team Newtry,

Firstly, your idea seems great and ambitious, the function of seeing the climate impact on the scanned product would be especially interesting. It would be a better alternative to the existing Nutriscore, which delivers too little information to be taken seriously in many cases and also is not available for many products.
There are a few questions I have regarding the content:
How would you gain the information about the scanned products? Do you have a specific API in mind, and which information would it deliver?
Also, how would you gauge the climate impact of the scanned product? Is there a way to calculate it using the ingredients, or do you have another solution for that?

Good luck with the project,
Team DHBWorld]]></wp:comment_content>

We're going to fix the first two improvement suggestions. Regarding the concrete environmental impact evaluation: as this is a pretty fundamental topic and there are multiple ways to implement this, this is going to be a topic for another post. But good spot right there! :)]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Daniel, thank you for your feedback! We're happy to see that we were able to convey our idea and intentions as supposed.

We were thinking about adding browser availability as well, but as those are mainly used on laptops and computers and scanning barcodes - one of the main features of the app - doesn't work well on these devices, we focus on app development for now. Maybe this is a feature we'll implement sometime in the future.

Despite that - thank you for the suggestion!]]></wp:comment_content>

Both of these topics offer many alternatives. As these are fundamental decisions we'd like to take time to carefully decide on this. Despite that, we've already thought about both of these topics and found a few ways to solve these issues. We'll keep you up-to-date in the coming blog posts. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

<p>Welcome back to our new blog post! Today we're going to get you guys familiar with the awesome team behind Newtry! So let's get things started right away. There are four students contributing to Newtry: Jakob, Jona, Norman and Oliver. Everyone of our team is a coder by heart and will have several roles - developer- as well as management-wise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:more -->
<!--more-->
<!-- /wp:more -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Overall structure</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before getting into the detailed role assignments let's briefly capture which areas need to be taken care of.<br>On the one hand we've got the actual <strong>implementation </strong>(development) for which we decided on creating two separate teams: one taking care of the <strong>frontend</strong> <strong>(Jona &amp; Jakob)</strong> and one being responsible for the <strong>backend (Norman &amp; Oliver)</strong>. Self-explanatory these roles might change over time as the task volume per team might be unbalanced or some work might be parallelized. Having dedicated teams has the advantage of speeding up the initial development phase as not everyone has to be an expert in every technology used and allows us to facilitate more in-depth knowledge faster. This nonetheless doesn't mean each team strictly keeps their focus on their tight scope - this is just giving directions as we're still running agile.<br>On the other hand we need some special roles for project management and administering our SCRUM lifecycle. As the following section is going to focus on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160321103943/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/apr05/crain/">RUP roles</a> we're going to define who's generally responsible for what at this point. Overall <strong>project management</strong> is going to be taken care of by <strong>Norman</strong>. <strong>SCRUM master</strong> during sprint planning and retrospectives is performed by <strong>Jona</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>RUP roles</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this section we're going to start talking about the <strong>development </strong>dedicated roles as well.<br>Of course, we want to adhere to coding best practices to deliver topnotch code (therefore products) but as well save time during development by preventing bugs from sneaking into our codebase. This is why everyone is responsible for <strong>designing, analyzing and writing tests</strong>. By doing this, the expertise of everyone is facilitated to its full potential as the in-depth knowledge of someone writing their own code is automatically transferred into test coverage. We also introduced a <strong>frontend (Jakob)</strong> and a<strong> backend (Norman)</strong> <strong>Test Manager</strong> to ensure that the quality of tests meets the requirements. <strong>Jona and Oliver</strong> will be responsible for the <strong>integration</strong> - this way overall code quality and structure is assured as well. In the future <strong>Oliver </strong>will also be responsible for setting up a pipeline for <strong>deployment</strong>.<br>Regarding project management <strong>Norman </strong>is going to fulfil most of the tasks. He'll be the <strong>project manager</strong> and <strong>product owner</strong> of our team. As a product owner one of his jobs is to prioritize and delegate tasks to the others.<br>Last but not least <strong>Jakob and Oliver</strong> are the guys keeping you updated in our <strong>blog </strong>:)</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We hope that you were able to get a good understanding of who's responsible for what in our team and we can't wait to tell you about our progress in our next blog post! Until then - stay agile not fragile. 😉</p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dear Newtry Team,

i find this approach to your project management is a rather good choice. Especially that all of you is responsible for writing tests as this leads to everyone learning something new all the time and you can also help each other out, which surely contributes to a better learning curve. 

With that said, it would be probably a good choice to not split people into back- and frontend devs. Like that your project may develop quicker but you're also not learning that much if everybody does what they can do best.

Best wishes,
Paul]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dear Newtry Team,

we really liked your role description. You gave a realistic view on which roles there are, how you split them in your group and also explained how these might change over time.
We could unfortunally not find any information about your technical Stack in this post. it was quite confusing, that you mentioned this in another post of yours since this was a requirenment for this weeks post. Maybe have a link to your previous blog post in here.

Best regards
your LectureFeed team 🌵]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Paul,

Thank you for your feedback! We would like to add that the split into front- and backend isn't a strict split. People who are assigned to the backend will also do frontend tasks if they want/ need to and vice versa. This way we have two experts for front- and backend who will focus on the corresponding tasks and will acquire more expertise than the others.

But thank you for your feedback!!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey LectureFeed team,

Thank you for your feedback! We're sorry to hear that we confused you with our post because we actually put a link to our last blogpost into the penultimate paragraph. We already knew which technologies we were going to use when we wrote our first blogpost. That's why we put the corresponding information into the first post. We didn't want to repeat ourselves and decided to just link the first post in here.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Welcome back to another long-awaited blog post! We're glad that you were able to get back to receive the latest updates on Newtry. This week's work included a lot of documentation and planning as we were setting up our <a href="https://github.com/TeamNewtry/NewtryDocumentation/blob/main/docs/SRS.md#22-use-case-diagram" data-type="URL">Use Case Diagram </a>(<strong>UCD</strong>) and our <a href="https://github.com/TeamNewtry/NewtryDocumentation/blob/main/docs/SRS.md" data-type="URL">Software Requirement Specification</a> (<strong>SRS</strong>). We're only going to cover the most important aspects to give you a brief overview. In case you're really keen on getting to know us (yes, who we really are 😘), you may click <a href="https://github.com/TeamNewtry/NewtryDocumentation/blob/main/docs/SRS.md" data-type="URL">here</a> if you want to see the whole SRS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":123,"width":294,"height":220,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="https://newtry.ionae.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/i-wanna-know-you-that-much-deeper-tyler-oakley.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-123" width="294" height="220"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So let's get started right away. The most important aspect of our SRS is that it is a "living document". Some aspects will change during the project and some details will be documented much later because they aren't relevant or finally decided on yet. Nonetheless we already know the features we want to implement so you guys can get hyped to see them pop up in our UCD 🥳</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Overall Use Case Diagram</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamNewtry/NewtryDocumentation/main/resources/Overall_Use_Case_Diagram.drawio.svg" alt=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our most important feature is the barcode scanning as it is the main functionality of our app. The scanned product should at least display ingredients and nutritional values. The next step is to include and calculate the climate impact score of each product because we want to help to make our future better! The community feature is the next item on our list. We want users to interact with each other which will help each individual to find the product fitting their personal preferences. Last but not least, we would like to host our own website which will provide a service similar to our app. This way users who already know the product they want to buy can inform themselves at home to find out which product fits their use case best.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's it for this week's post! We hope that you enjoyed the short dive into our plans. We're happy to see you next week. Until then, keep it ready and steady!</p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Howdy Newtry team,
we read your blogpost and want to give you some feedback:

we like that you...
... explained your priorization of your goals
... structured your documentation well 
... give interesting references in your SRS ;)

However, we would change the following things:
 - include the graphics as SVGs instead of PNGs in SRS. That would allow the user to zoom in without having a "blurry" effect.
- You state that you want to develop an app for IOS. Don't you need to own a developer license in order to do? (We did not find any information about that in your SRS) 

We are very keen on further updates and hope, that we could give you some helpful feedback.

Cheerio, 
The PiXS Team]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Newtry team,

we really enjoyed reading your blog post 😀! You guys seem to have a clear vision in mind about what you want to achieve. It is also a good idea to prioritize the different use cases. This helps not to get distracted during the execution. 

In your SRS you state that the actors of your app will be "users or moderators". However, on your UCD you only show registered and anonymous users. Maybe you could explain what you mean by "moderators" and which actions they can perform.

Also, there are some spelling errors at the beginning of your SRS (1.2). I would suggest "website" instead of "webiste" and "anonymous and registered users are able to search products via the search bar" 😉 .

We wish you much success and are excited about coming updates 😁!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Team Newtry,

I read your blogpost with great interest and I would like to give some feedback. I like the way you designed the UCD, especially how colors were used to indicate which use cases belong to which priority.

While reading your SRS I noticed that there still is a TODO under "Deployment", but as you mentioned the SRS is a living document and will change over time, so just keep in mind to update this bullet point after making a decision regarding deployment.😉

I also like that you decided on precise coding and testing standards, that way you won't have to deal with messy code in the future.

Regards

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Howdie PiXS Team,

thank you very much for you instructive feedback. We adapted the images to SVG.
Regarding the iOS license: the focus lies on mobile device independent development. Therefore we chose a technology stack which natively supports Android & iOS with just one codebase. The required license may be acquired when deploying the app as testing can be done without one present as well.

Cheers,
Team Newtry]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Howdy Newtry team, 
thanks for your answer regarding the developer license. 
Besides, we just took another closer look at your UCD and realized that you should point out the specific use-cases more consisely, using nouns in combination with verbs. 
You might change "Ratings" to "Submit Ratings" and "Show/Display Ratings", which would clarify the use case.
Once again, Cheeerio,

<h2>Take a gaze at a use case</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Howdy, and welcome back! This time we worked on something tangible... something you may actually see some time in the future, when stumbling upon our app... drum roll... USE-CASES!<br>Nah just kidding, project management stuff aside, let's dive into some mockups. (As always, check out our <a href="https://github.com/TeamNewtry/NewtryDocumentation/tree/main/use_cases">github repository</a> for more information and the detailed use cases) </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:more -->
<!--more-->
<!-- /wp:more -->

<!-- wp:image {"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamNewtry/NewtryDocumentation/main/resources/Home.png" alt=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can see our home screen on the picture above, looks good right? Searching and scanning products are the essential features of our app, which is why decided to make them accessible all from one screen. The overall design is very simplistic because we don't want the user to be distracted by too many features on one screen.  In today's blogpost we will take a closer look at the barcode scanning functionality. You can access this feature by clicking the (who guessed it?) barcode button at the bottom of the screen. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamNewtry/NewtryDocumentation/main/resources/Scan.png" alt=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This will lead to a new page with a barcode scanner which will scan any code you'll feed it (most of them at least). After the barcode has been scanned, you'll find yourself with every possible detail about the product you may dream of. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"width":434,"height":794,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamNewtry/NewtryDocumentation/main/resources/Real_ingredients.png" alt="" width="434" height="794"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ingredient page will be close to the one in the screenshot but the language will be adjusted to the language chosen in the settings of course. Searching for the same product using the search bar shown in the first picture will lead to the exact same screen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":10} -->
<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These screenshots should cover most of the features of our app. We hope that you enjoyed these first impressions (as much as the title suggests 😏)!<br>For those of you interested in which tools we used: <a href="https://www.figma.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> for mockups &amp; <a href="https://app.diagrams.net/">Draw.io</a> for the OUCDs (with <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio">Draw.io integration</a> and <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare">Live Share</a> plugins in VS Code for collaborative editing)<br>You can also check <a href="https://newtryabout.ionae.de/">this</a> link if you are interested in our thought process throughout the mockup! 😊</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And remember to never resign when you try to design! See you next week.</p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dear newtry-team,

The mockup illustrates your vision of newtry very well. You get a clear idea of the UI and the connections. The activity diagrams are very well structured and clear, but they could be more detailed, e.g. in the use case show ingredients, the communication between client and server could be described more precisely.

Yours the LectureFeed Team]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello Newtry,

I must admit that I'm extremely impressed with the design of the mock-ups (and your whole website on that note).
The 1. &amp; 2. use cases were really easy to understand because of that. Especially helpful were the well structured activity diagrams.

Your professional yet on point blogs and documentation most certainly make you stand out. I barley found anything to complain about.

Your thought process too was most intriguing.
We will definitely take that aspect into consideration for our future use cases. 
I hope you never gonna give up putting in such great effort!

Friendly regards,
Art+Game]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dear Newtry-Team,

we are amazed of how well your mock-ups already look like.  We also like how you explain what you were thinking when creating the designs.  All of your use case descriptions are easy to understand and well thought of.  
The only thing which would be interesting to know is which tools you used for creating the mock-ups and/or activity diagrams. If you use new tools, you might want to include these in your future posts.
Nevertheless,  by looking at the great effort you put into the project,  we are sure that your project can be a huge success.

Best,
Your PlanIt-Team]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello LectureFeed team,

thank you very much for your instructive feedback!
We thought about going into more detail at the client-server communication as well. In the end we decided to keep it as abstract as possible as more detail would have automatically implied a client-server architecture and we haven't fully decided on that yet as an asynchronous message-bus and other architectures are still good alternatives for our use case.

Cheers,
Team Newtry]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title><![CDATA[No Gin Tonic without Cucumber!]]></title>
		<link>https://newtry.ionae.de/?p=158</link>
		<pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 16:38:14 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Welcome back to our blog! First of all, we're as devastated as you: this post isn't about gin tonic. But we're here to save the day so we highly recommend trying out <a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/354232/cucumber-mint-gin-and-tonic">this</a> recipe ;)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:more -->
<!--more-->
<!-- /wp:more -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyways let's get started with the real content. The message we want to spread is that you should never write code without tests. It just feels good when your tests pass and it will save you a lot of trouble in the future (introducing the same bugs over and over is no fun, trust me). In this case our tests are written in Cucumber. Cucumber is a testing framework which intends to provide human readable tests which is not only good for you (save time by combining specification and writing tests) but for the client as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As always, it would be way too much information if we explained the tests for all our use cases. That's why we're going to feature the "search bar" use case as an example in this post. You can visit our <a href="https://github.com/TeamNewtry/NewtryDocumentation/blob/main/use_cases">git repository</a> if you're interested in the other use cases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamNewtry/NewtryDocumentation/main/resources/UC1_Searchbar.drawio.svg" alt=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the activity diagram for the search bar. You will see that our Gherkin (language in which Cucumber tests are written) specification resembles the flow and the various "scenarios" quite well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":161,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://newtry.ionae.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Unbenannt-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-161"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you can see, there are editors out there with support for writing Gherkin. Highlighting, auto-completion, suggestions... everything you'd expect from a decently known programming language. Personally we're using VS Code with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexkrechik.cucumberautocomplete">Cucumber (Gherkin) Full Support</a> plugin. Anyways, let's get back to the tests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When using the search bar, the user has to click on the search bar first to open up the keyboard. Afterwards, the user is able to enter the desired product which will either result in a list of all matching products or in an error message being shown on the screen. The user is able to click on one of the products in case of a successful search.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's it for this week's blogpost we hope that you enjoyed the Cucumber tests!<br>And here's a small poem to show our affection for gin:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:verse -->
<pre class="wp-block-verse">So I sit and I wait
When it's time for bed
For that gin and tonic
To go to my head</pre>
<!-- /wp:verse -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cheers!</p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey,
we did not yet try your given recipe but really liked the structure of this weeks blog entry.

We wondered tho, if the scenario of the on screen keyboard opening is part of the application you are writing or the functionality of the operating system the client is running on. If e.g. the client is running in an environment, where a physical keyboard is plugged into the device and no on screen keyboard is shown, should the test still fail? This is very nitpicky, but maybe worth mentioning :)

Apart from that, we tried finding your feature file, as you may have others to show, but we did not find the files in the repository you linked to, maybe you have them somewhere but the repository is set to private?

We are looking forward to reading about the future progress of your idea.

Regards,
your DueTo-team]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello DueTo team,

thank you very much for your instructive feedback!
Regarding the workflow management of the keyboard: You're right - in all modern devices this should automatically be handled by the operating system. But as this specification is just an abstract requirement specification and doesn't take into account OS specific behaviors it is listed in there as well. Thanks for mentioning this!

About the rest of the feature files: The original files are in the actual project repository which is indeed private. But they are present in the respective Use Case Specifications in our NewtryDocumentation repository.

Cheers,
Team Newtry]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dear Team Newtry, 
first of all you did a great job at this weeks blog. Great work!
In my opinion your scenarios look great but not perfect. Let's change this together. 
In your second and third scenario the part after "Given" starts with "that I...". This sentences look a bit off. I would change it to "I get to see the keyboard".
It would be even better if you get your scenarios to not depend on each other. For example you could just skip the step where you use the keyboard to do the inputs and use something like:
"Given I am on the homepage
When I search for "abcde" 
..." 
This way you can skip the UI which is tested in a different scenario and just send a POST-Request. 
Furthermore I do not think you need more than one option the bot can search.  If you got different results for a search using numbers this sounds like an extra-scenario. Otherwise I would just test one input.
The last scenario shown ends with "Then a new page is shown". This is quite unprecise. For example a 404-errorpage is a new page as well. Personally I would just change it to check which page is shown. 
One example could be "Then I get redirected to https://lecturefeed.wordpress.com/" 
We enjoyed your poem though (:

<p>Welcome back party people to our latest blogpost! We decided to stick with what works best for us and present you a new cocktail every week in addition to our usual progress. This week's cocktail is a real classic which is known as the Cuba Libre. You can check it out by following <a href="https://cocktails.de/cocktail-rezepte/cuba-libre-cocktail">this link</a> (and you should definitely try it!). But we'd also like to feature another classic: Scrum! Aforementioned usually looks as follows:</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whoopsie... wrong scrum process, sorry! We actually wanted to talk about project management instead of rugby .... But at least it illustrates one aspect of Scrum which is teamwork. A Scrum team usually consists of so-called teams of ten. Most of the people in a team are developers but there's a Scrum Master (SM) and a Product Owner (PO), as well. In our case, Norman takes responsibility as the PO which means that he's responsible for our product. At the moment he's organizing and prioritizing our backlog items. Jona is our SM, he's responsible for everything regarding the Scrum process which could be things like a sprint's retrospective. In our case a sprint lasts one week. We were already doing Scrum since the first week because we think it's the easiest way to organize ourselves. You can get an overview of all our previous sprints by taking a look at our <a href="https://dhbw-karlsruhe.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/projects/77651022-e156-4357-a251-e794beb94fa5">dashboard</a>. As you can see we went with YouTrack as our go-to tool for putting Scrum into practice.</p>

<p>You can see an example of our first sprint's burndown in the picture shown above. The green line indicates the ideal burndown, the dark blue line resembles the remaining effort and the light blue one represents the time already spent. The current board for our sprint looks as follows:</p>

<p>And... That's it for this week's blogpost. We hope that you enjoyed yourselves on your way through it and had a great weekend! Here's  a poem to give rum some love:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:verse -->
<pre class="wp-block-verse">When I get rum I'm all over the place
If it is smooth I won't need a chase
If it tastes good that would be a disgrace
But if I have too much don't get in my face

I like rum
To get me numb
But sometimes I get dumb

One down and my fun side shows
Two more and my libido grows
One more and then who knows
Six and the negativity flows

I start getting aggrevated
My temper gets elevated
My mouth gets antiquated

Lord help me if I get seven down
Pretty soon I'll be heaven bound
~ <a href="https://allpoetry.com/poems/about/rum">Pusillanimous</a></pre>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello Newtry,

your blogs are always a delight to read. Really makes me want to crack open a cold one.

The fact that you used scrum at the very start of your project is proven through your well established dashboard.
We only recently started using scrum ourselves and your team gives us a prime example on how to do it properly.

The only problem with this blog are the provided pictures as they are hard to read even when opened in a new tab.
Pictures with higher resolution would be nice (although not necessary considering your dashboard).

Friendly regards,
Art+Game]]></wp:comment_content>

we visited your blog for the first time and really enjoyed reading. Greets to your creativity part. 
Your Burndown chart shows that you are an organiced and well coorparating team. 
Looking on your burndown it looks like your time planning is maybe a little too goodwilling. You could think of adjusting your estimation based on your expiriences so far.

Your blog post is very interesting. You show us how you use scrum. 

One thing isn't the best, the text on teh pictures is to small to read.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello Art+Game team,

thank you very much for your instructive feedback!
Regarding the resolution problem: We either use images with a high resolution or SVGs to be able to prevent those kind of problems. The issue in this case seems to be throttling done by WordPress itself. You may circumvent this by using a faster connection or higher screen resolution - try clearing your cache before reloading to see changes. Another approach would be to open the respective image in a new tab and remove the specific resolution appended to the file name to get the original resolution.

thank you very much for your instructive feedback!
Regarding our estimations: We intentionally try to budget for possible delays, fluctuations etc as some task cannot be estimated very precisely. That's why we estimate for the worst-case scenario in order to minimize the risk of getting behind schedule.

<p>Aloha mai e ko'u mau hoa! Or for those of you who don't speak Hawaiian (including us): Welcome back my friends! We decided that the winter mood should end right now which is why we'd like to present you a refreshing cocktail: the <a href="https://cocktails.de/cocktail-rezepte/pink-cucumber-lemonade-cocktail">Pink Cucumber Lemonade</a>. You should really give this one a try on hot summer days! But anyways let's get started with the real content, our class diagram.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:more -->
<!--more-->
<!-- /wp:more -->

<!-- wp:image {"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamNewtry/NewtryDocumentation/main/resources/Class_Diagram.drawio.svg" alt=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First of all, we had some troubles defining a class diagram for our application because JavaScript is rather... special. Despite being object-oriented it's classless and rather prototype-based. We've still tried our best to describe the relationship between the various entities in terms of how they would be implemented in a typical OOP language like Java. The heart of our backend is implemented via Cloud Functions - a feature of Firebase which allows us to focus on plain development as the backend is deployed "serverless". To access these functions, the app will contain a <code>CloudFunctionsWrapper</code> which acts as an interface. The main class <code>App</code> uses the <code>CloudFuntionsWrapper</code> to fetch products and possible matches for search queries in case they aren't already cached. So in case a class wants to fetch a product's details, it would call the <code>getProductByGTIN</code> method of the <code>App</code> class which either directly returns the respective instance from the <code>productsCache</code> or fetches it from the database by calling the equivalent method in the <code>CloudFunctionsWrapper</code>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The products are then represented by a separate data-class called <code>Product</code> which contains a lot of properties (take a look at the screenshot). Some of these properties are objects by themselves, which is why a product has methods to fetch these properties in a properly formatted manner. As nutritional values consist of a fixed set of attributes they are implemented via their own data-class called <code>Nutrition</code> which in turn is referenced to by a product. Last but not least, a product may receive some comments and ratings. A <code>Comment</code> consists of typical data like the title or actual content and a reference to the user that wrote it. A <code>User</code> exhibits attributes like username and email but keeps a reference to all comments the user wrote as well. This way, we may include a feature to inspect all previously written comments of oneself in the future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's it for our class diagram, we hope you got a sufficient understanding of what we're trying to achieve. In case questions arose, don't hesitate to put them in the comments! And concluding: a poem to present you the benefits of <a href="https://cocktails.de/cocktail-rezepte/pink-cucumber-lemonade-cocktail">lemonade</a> in the summer:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:verse -->
<pre class="wp-block-verse">Summer's the time
For lemonade.
We'll have some here
That mother made.
Let's sip it in
The nice cool shade,
Until summer's heat
Begins to fade.
-Karen McGuigan Brothers</pre>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dear Newtry team,

I really enjoyed reading your blog post. It was - as always - very humorous but also informative at the same time 😁. Your class diagram looks very good to me (although I do not have much experience with class diagrams myself 😅) and I feel like you guys have a lot of expertise and know what you are doing. I have nothing to criticize right now so the only thing left to say is keep up the great work and much success!

Best regards

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Newtry,

we enjoyed reading your blog post.  It is nice that you managed to construct the relationships between the  entities of your class diagram  in an OOP language style and clarified why you had difficulties creating the diagram while using JavaScript for your project. Your class diagram is well structured. The  explanations below it help follow what you are trying to achieve and make it easier to understand.

Best of luck and keep up the good work!

P.S. Thank you for the cocktail suggestion, it looks delicious. We might try it in the future ;D

Regards,

the DueTo team]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Newtry,
looks like managed to create a well-structured class diagram. It's interesting to read your thoughts behind the construction of the diagram and see how you  managed to get past the problem of having a class diagram although using JavaScript. Your further explanation made it really easy to understand each part of your diagram.
Keep up the good work!
Best,

<p>Welcome back to our latest post! Today we're trying to take a look at the past. We know that sometimes it's hard to remember what you did on Saturday night or on the whole weekend but nevertheless you should always try to remember all your deeds.... Despite this, you should try out <a href="https://cocktails.de/cocktail-rezepte/long-island-iced-tea-cocktail">this</a> cocktail if you want to have a real challenge remembering the weekend. Here's some footage of us on the weekends:  </p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But we're here to take a look at the past weeks so that's it for cocktails (at least until the end of this post 😉). We already did a retrospective before the one we did together in class which is why we'd like to give you some impressions of our own private retro. It took place in week 5 and was quite similar to the one we had in class. </p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you can see in this table, we were quite satisfied with ourselves. We only had some small aspects we were dissatisfied with but we tried our best to change them. In addition to that, we wanted to give each other some love and praise which is why we wrote some sort of "love letters" (we can't let our childhood mantras end yet being this young)</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you can see, we gave each other a lot of love and affection. In general, we are quite happy with our team's overall situation and can't wait for our project's bright future! As usual, to round up the blogpost: Here's a poem to give some love and affection to the cocktail mentioned in the first paragraph: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:verse -->
<pre class="wp-block-verse">Nothing better then getting back from family celebration
To come home and take a mini vacation
And sitting on the couch with a tall glass of medication
When you're in a spot where you don't want to be
Relax a while with a long island iced tea

Things not going your way?
Has it just been a shitty day?
Have you been working to hard?
Perhaps someone run off with your credit card

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello Newtry team,

thank you for your insight in the team retrospective. It is nice to know that every team has its own difficulties to deal with. So it does not feel to bad if you have some in your own team...
Also thanks for the tip about the long island iced tea. 
We think that the idea with the "love letters" is pretty nice to keep the team motivated and create a nice atmosphere within the team. We hope you can work on your "schlecht" category. We are looking forward to your project. Maybe there is a second retrospective in the next semester to compare.

Best regards,
DHBWorld team.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Newtry,

nice dance moves ;)

Very cool that you had already made a retro in advance.
That everything seems to be going well for you is of course nice to hear, and we also like the idea with the "love letters".

We hope that it will look similar well for you all in the retro next semester.

Best regards,
Team Workout-log]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This week's blog post features a cocktail which is often associated with class. Unfortunately,  Daniel Craig didn't make it to our blogpost because he was too busy playing poker on his secret mission. You should try <a href="https://cocktailbart.de/cocktails/cocktails-mit-gin/martini/">this</a> cocktail (maybe without the poison 😉) if you want to become the next James Bond. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/b9DzOe5w6c7UsDl5b1" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyways, let's get started with the content: the refinement of our class diagrams. This week's work included the specification of our app's architecture which looks as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamNewtry/NewtryDocumentation/main/resources/Class_Diagram_Architecture.drawio.svg" alt=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you can see above, our architecture follows Facebook's Flux pattern. Flux is an application architecture for React applications which consists of 4 major components:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>View: consists of everything the user sees and represents the UI &amp; has to listen to changes from the stores and re-render itself</li><li>Action Creator: creates actions (Thank you captain obvious!). An action is an object with a type property and data. An example for an action could be entering a product in the search bar.</li><li>Dispatcher: processes registered actions and callbacks (think of it as a router, routing actions from the Action Creator to the Stores)</li><li>Store: holds the state &amp; logic of an application (think of it managing a specific domain rather than a single object as a model in MVC would do)</li><li>[Separate from Flux] Web API Utils: responsible for providing an interface to backend functions</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Besides the Web API Utils, these four components are connected in the following cyclic way: View -> Action Creator -> Dispatcher -> Store -> View</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can check out our <a href="https://github.com/TeamNewtry/NewtryDocumentation/blob/main/docs/SAD.md">GitHub</a> if you're interested in the whole SAD, but I think that's enough input for today. In addition to that, we put some effort into our YouTrack as well. Recursive tasks, like writing the blogpost, are now auto generated which will save us a lot of time in the future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that's it for this week's blog post. As usually here's a nice poem about Martinis:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:verse -->
<pre class="wp-block-verse">There is something about a Martini,
A tingle remarkably pleasant;
A yellow, a mellow Martini;
I wish I had one at present.
There is something about a Martini,
Ere the dining and dancing begin,
And to tell you the truth,
It is not the vermouth--
I think that perhaps it's the gin.
-<a href="https://hellopoetry.com/words/martini/">Ogden Nash</a></pre>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi,

Your blog post this week is very clear and detailed, and we saw no real flaws with either the diagram or the content of the post itself. The color coding of the diagram itself was self-explanatory and made it easy to understand. I am interested how the flux pattern will actually work once the app is done.

Best regards

your blog post was very nicely written and easy to understand.
We love the Fact that you colour coded your Diagram to make it easy to understand.
One Thing we didn't quit get was what framework you are using. You mentioned React but maybe a clarification would be good.
As always we had a lot of fun reading your Blogpost.

<p>Dear ladies and gentleman,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>we're sorry to bring this to you but this will be our last blog post. After numerous heated discussions we had to make this decision for the better... In this case for the better means coming back strengthened with a bunch of even more disruptive innovations to incorporate into our current solution, in the next year. For now we want to thank you for your ubiquitous support and want to recap on what happened throughout this semester. First let us give you an overview of the dozens of documents we created in the meantime:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In case you missed it: this post isn't just about listing everything we've done so far and saying goodbye. We wouldn't just do that to you folks. Before going away for a short while, we created a demo for you to actually see our app in action - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaNONB83HHs">go check it out!</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But as all things have to get to an end we'll have to say goodbye until next year and wish you pleasant holidays with family and friends. What an awesome opportunity to expand your horizon and savor through the awesome cocktail recipes we posted in our previous blog posts. Family dinner is always funnier with grandma being a little tipsy and pulling out some funny stories. As always, keep your head up and see you on the other side of history!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Cheers</p>

As we're extremely hyped  for this semester's blogposts (i.e. cocktails 😉), we self-explainingly savoured the April Rain thoroughly.  Nevertheless, let's get started with the Newtry content, even though you'd prefer some more of these awesome drinks. 😜</p>

<p>Just as a reminder upfront: you can find a summary of last semester's work at <a href="https://newtry.ionae.de/?p=213#more-213">this</a> blogpost.  Due to completing last semester's scope successfully, we will start with the implementation of our second semester's scope right away. </p>

<p>As shown on the picture above, our second semester's scope consists of:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>show climate impact score</li><li>registration and login</li><li>submit and show ratings</li><li>write and show comments</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to these features we will work on covering the application with tests by using the JEST framework. As always: here's a poem in the context of the April Rain Cocktail!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:verse -->
<pre class="wp-block-verse">Let the rain kiss you.
Let the rain beat upon your heat with silver liquid drops.
Let the rain sing you a lullaby.
The rain makes still pools on the sidewalk.
The rain makes running pools in the gutter.
The rain plays a little sleep-song on our roof at night—
And I love the rain.

<p>Welcome back party people! Today we're taking a look at a cocktail which will definitely require some risk management if you don't want to end up in a hospital. Even though there are various classic cocktails, like the <strong>Zombie</strong> which fit into this category, we decided to go with something a little "extra". Therefore, we chose the <a href="https://www.liquor.com/recipes/death-in-the-afternoon/">Death in the Afternoon</a> as the cocktail of the week! Managing risk with this cocktail will be a hard,  as the sole ingredients are absinthe and champagne....</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since we could not assess the risks of such cocktails for ourselves, we opted for risk management of our application instead 😉<br>The following figure shows a shortened version of our identified risks. Click <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W7UelNuCG9qBwyAbcoquFlbNB5FOV4KLdhpQOWmoB2M/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> for the full version. </p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The major problem we are facing right now, is that data that can be used to calculate a climate impact score is rarely maintained in the Open Food Facts database. Therefore, we might need to think of a new way to go about this. Another solution for this problem would be to fetch climate related data from another source. The other risks listed in the figure above are of lower priority, as they have a low risk factor and can be resolved easily when occurring. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to this, we also worked on the details for this semester's use cases. You can take a detailed look at them right <a href="https://github.com/TeamNewtry/NewtryDocumentation/tree/main/use_cases">here</a>. Unfortunately, we didn't find any non-depressing poems dealing with this week's cocktail 😐<br>We still hope you enjoyed this blogpost despite the absence of the poem 😊</p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi, we found this weeks bloc post to be rad af and hope all of your risks are managed tightly😎.
What we also found is minor grammar mistakes, its 'in' and not 'on' the figure (3rd sentence under the figure).

It is nice to see your comparably low risk factors, they really show the success of your project management activities. Additionally,  it's nice to see that you follow Prof. Brauns approach to just not get ill, as your propability of getting ill is pretty low🙃. 

I wonder how the Impact of "Unable to get data from Open Food Facts" is lower than "Insufficient data for climate impact score"? In my understanding, in case of a failure of Open Food Facts, the climate impact data would be affected as well🤔.

Best wishes and may you find sufficient climate impact data,
Philipp from Wizard vs. Robots]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Newtry-Team,

first of all we enjoyed reading your blog post.
The risks you put in your Excel-sheet look logical in our opinion. But we are missing some risks related to project management or other areas than mostly functionality. Also you put into the "person of charge" just "everyone" everywhere. It's better to explicitly define one person for each risks so that every risk gets monitored correctly. When everyone is responsable for anything, nobody is responsible.

But all in all we think you described your risks pretty accurate for your project and the color-coding helps to understand your overall image of your risk management.

Regards,
DHBWorld-Team]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Philipp,

thank you very much for your instructive (and humorous 🙃) feedback!
We fixed the grammar mistake you mentioned and updated the sorting accordingly.

Regarding the choice of impact of the climate impact score and inability to retrieve data from OFF:
We specifically named the item "Insufficient data for climate impact score", as the data required for this isn't necessarily limited to data from OFF. Therefore these two items are more uncoupled and can be considered separately.

Cheers,
Team Newtry]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello Christian,

thank you very much for your instructive feedback!
We thought about other areas like project management as well, but for us there were no issues that were really noteworthy. We had some ideas, but these were mostly forced and not really applicable/useful.
Regarding responsibility: All of the risks identified above are risks that would affect the whole project. That means, there would practically be no possibility of someone not noticing these problems. That not only applies to monitoring, but mitigating the risks as well, as further strategies have to be chosen in a conclusive way which the whole team agrees on.

We hope, we could alleviate your doubts and are keen on seeing further feedback from you!

Cheers,
Team Newtry]]></wp:comment_content>

<p>Hello and welcome back to our latest blogpost! To get you into the mood for this week's  cocktails, we need to cover the story of the well-known <a href="https://www.liquor.com/recipes/classic-bloody-mary/">Bloody Mary</a> (maybe we should also write about story points). As with many classics, the originator of the Bloody Mary is highly debated but most people agree that Fernand Petiot, a young bartender at Harry's New York Bar in Paris, should be credited with the creation of this serve in the 1920s. It is passed down that a Russian prince ordered this savoury serve and asked for some extra spice. That's when Petiot created the Bloody Mary by choosing Tabasco as his ingredient of choice. Now that we're in the mood for some even better stories, we can start with Story points! </p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First of all, we decided to subdivide our use cases by using story points instead of function points. The latter would require us having to manually assign all commits of our code base (and documentation) to a specific UC. Therefore, this alone would produce more workload, than the outcomes of this exercise will most likely save in time. Let's continue diving into the SPs.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you can see above, we decided to distribute our story points using powers of 2.  Our team (except for Jakob, he's special) agreed on most of the values chosen per UC and concluded the figures shown in the second column. The 'all' UC includes the non-UC specific setup of the app which includes a lot of tinkering and time. Therefore, we assigned it 16 SPs. Furthermore, we concluded that it would be wise to declare the 'searchbar' UC with more SPs, as it provides a lot of functionality which is reused in the other UCs. The following graph shows the time per UC in relation to the SP:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This week's poem is a little longer than usual but it's definitely worth reading:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:verse -->
<pre class="wp-block-verse">Red is the colour,
dense is the taste;
it’s savoured even better
if drank without haste!

I don’t put much into it …
its look’s usually raw,
but a good friend added these …
an umbrella … a fancy straw!

It’s not a favourite of many …
draws frowns on many faces;
for me it’s not peculiar,
enjoyed more with friendship traces.

The recipe is simple:
a tall, plain glass;
Ice cubes three;
no measurements to pass!

Around a sixth of vodka,
the rest tomato juice,
a dash of Worchestershire,
some Tabasco drops to spruce.

A pinch of fine salt,
another one of pepper;
in go the ice cubes;
a good stir like a rapper.

Try it out, who knows?
Maybe with me you’d agree!
And, if even you won’t like it,
don’t worry … I’ll gladly drink for free!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello newtry, 
thank you for bringing some culture with history and a poem to my day.
Can you explain a little more how the points are choosenand what they mean? 
I like your table and it sounds well thought but the values are not quite clear to me. 
As your graph shows the use cases are all close to your trend line what i think shows that you first managed you use cases well but also decided correctly about the setup of you story points calculation. 
Best regards,
your nEXam team]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello newtry Team,
thank you for this weeks block, it truly was a pleasant read. Since I haven't read all of your other blogs some direct links to the UC would have been very handy.  Of course this is just some nitpicking but other than that I think your blog covers just about everything there is to cover. I agree with the other comment that you could given more reason for the amount of story points per use case, but then again, most of the time it is gut feeling and experience ;).
The only thing I find a little curious is that your "all" UC has such a high amount of story points. I understand that some things just don't really belong to a specific UC, but if there is so much general work to be done, maybe you should have defined more UC's ?
Anyways I thank you for the lovely poetry and the very interesting lore behind the Blood Mary :D

Best wishes

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello team nEXam,

thank you very much for your instructive feedback!

The story points are a measure for how much effort (time) is required to complete the respective UC. How the specific discrete values are chosen is up to you. You could for one, choose Fibonacci numbers, but you could also choose powers of two (as we did). As long you have an increasing sequence of "difficulty" which is somehow proportional to the time spent, you're fine.

As we finished the first four UCs in the first semester, we had a pretty accurate estimation for how much time went into these and how much story points we should assign. With this attribution to the story points in mind, we could estimate the time required for the UCs of this semester and apply the story points accordingly.

Cheers,
Team Newtry]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello Leon from team WvR,

thank you very much for your instructive feedback!

A more detailed explanation of how we chose the story points has been given under the comment you mentioned. :)

I agree, that the 'all' UCs gives the impression you described. In our case, it contains only the following components:
- meetings, discussions and decision-making for all encompassing topics (not related to a single UC)
- organisational tasks (YouTrack...)
- blog  posts, peer reviews etc.
I hope you can understand, that these wouldn't really fit into a UC regarding the app itself. The only possibility would be to create another UC for organisational topics, to differentiate these from the other aforementioned aspects.

Cheers,
Team Newtry]]></wp:comment_content>

<p>Welcome back to our latest blogpost! Yes, you're at the right place, even though the title doesn't have to do with cocktails this time. Due to the deep desire to apologize for this inconvenience (and as an apology for the bad test-jokes which will follow shortly), we want to present you a super awesome cocktail which you should definitely test 😉<br>This week's cocktail is the <a href="https://cocktailbart.de/cocktails/cocktails-mit-wodka/moscow-mule/">Moscow Mule</a> which is actually Jakob's favorite cocktail right now, so go ahead and test it 😃<br>But let's leave the good sides of life aside and start with the real content because we don't want our software to look like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:more -->

<!-- /wp:more -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","width":332,"height":323,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/QfyGKmszKdBT2/giphy.gif" alt="" width="332" height="323"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First of all, we put a total amount of fourteen badges on our <a href="https://github.com/TeamNewtry/Newtry">main repository</a> because Prof. Berk stated "this would help us to increase our grades significantly". So, here's a screenshot of our badges because they increase our quality by their pure presence on the main page.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":258,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://newtry.ionae.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Capture.png" alt="" class="wp-image-258"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The choice of our testing framework was rather simple because Jest is probably the most-renowned JavaScript testing framework as it's able to perform unit, integration and end-to-end testing. Furthermore, the Jest syntax is quite intuitive and Jest has a built-in React-Native support which allows for effortless testing (despite being quite a bit of hassle regarding non-compiled and complex dependencies) of the rendering process of the app's pages. Here's a short example which tests if the app itself is rendered correctly:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>import 'react-native';
import React from 'react';
import App from '../src/App';

// Note: test renderer must be required after react-native.
import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';

it('renders correctly', () =&gt; {
  renderer.create(&lt;App /&gt;);
});
</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jest will create a so-called snapshot instead of rendering the whole app when running this test. This snapshot is compared to the app's previous snapshot. The test passes if the snapshots equal and fails if they're not. The snapshot which is used for the comparison is created when running the test for the first time.  Snapshots can be updated by running the test with the <em>updateSnapshot</em> flag:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>jest --updateSnapshot</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, we also added a <a href="https://github.com/TeamNewtry/NewtryBackend/tree/main/postman">Postman collection </a>to test our API. This collection uses Postman to simulate requests to the API. The API's responses are compared to a predefined outcome.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to this, we also set up a CI pipeline using Github Actions to automatically run our tests when pushing to a repository. The following screenshot shows our recent workflow runs: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":261,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://newtry.ionae.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Capture-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-261"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, we want to present to you the testing framework's integration into our IDE (Webstorm), so here's a super exciting screenshot of the Jest integration in Webstorm (you just have to add a new run configuration which offers a predefined template for Jest):</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":266,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://newtry.ionae.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Jest-Webstorm-integration.png" alt="" class="wp-image-266"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last but not least, Jest also generates a very neat code coverage report for you, which looks as follows in our situation:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":268,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://newtry.ionae.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Jest-coverage.png" alt="" class="wp-image-268"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We hope that you enjoyed reading this week's blogpost and as always: Here's a small poem featuring this week's cocktail (even though it's pretty short this time):</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:verse -->
<pre class="wp-block-verse">moscow mule kicks a ginger-lime twist
afore ice-cold pins, afar needles kissed
by clouds of cotton spun to mirror light

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey team Newtry,
It is  great to read such an image-assisted blog where you don't have to look through million of file by yourself.
Good to see that you followed Prof Berkling's advice with badges and got creative with it. I think we'll have to copy some of them 😉. 
All in all, you did all you have to do for that week and presented it in detail. The only thing I would suggest you is change the font color of the second and third picture. I don't know if's because of my dark mode, but I can't read the text without marking it.
Keep up the good work, and we wish you all the best for your upcoming tasks!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Newtry-Team,

you have done a good job with your blog, which is pleasant to read. Only me personally disturbs the gif something. Since you want to concentrate on the text, all the time out of the corner of your eye sees something move. But I think that's just my personal opinion and not a general disadvantage. 
Nice that you have implemented the proposal with the badges with great enthusiasm. I think the screenshot of your badges (and the screenshots below) would increase the quality of your blog again, if the image quality was a bit higher.  I also have to agree with the comment above, the code snippets are really hard to read. 
Otherwise, it sounds like you're on a really good path with testing, and your setup for testing sounds promising. 

Regards,
deX-Team]]></wp:comment_content>

thank you very much for your instructive feedback!
As mentioned in the reply above we will try to choose colours better - thank you. :)
We can understand the problem you are having with the gifs, but we think the gifs are great for cheering readers up.
Thank you for your feedback on the Screenshots. We hope we can increase quality but we also have to keep in mind that WordPress is not entirely innocent and likes to scale images.

Have a great day,

<p>... oh hello! Welcome to our latest post! Maybe you're wondering about the title. But yes, it happened again... If you don't know what we are talking about, we would strongly advise you to take a look at the wonderful blog post&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newtry.ionae.de/?p=190" target="_blank">Ahead to the past</a>. But we would be lying if we said it was the same as last time. This time there was more...more... LOVE - Talking about love, have you ever tried the lovely cocktail "<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.edeka.de/rezepte/rezept/cocktail-joy-of-love.jsp" target="_blank">Joy of Love</a>"? Never? Ohhh wait till I ... </p>

<p>... well sorry back to love. Taking a look at the last retrospective we can see, that there was not that much to improve. The only thing was the distribution of tasks which has improved because we're all nearly on the same level now. But let's have a look at the whiteboard of the new retrospective.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you can see, we've had a lot of achievements. One of them is the state of the app. We've nearly finished it which leads to happy feelings. There are not only achievements but also celebrations. We have celebrated and praised every time when a feature was finished. And yes there were celebrations on weekend. Thinking about what was hard in the beginning we thought about the whole organisation part. <br>Looking for what we could do better in future projects is firstly more party and secondly write the poems ourselfs. Furthermore, we've learned a lot while having a great time with Newtry. <br><br>Last but not least, let's take a look at the romantic part of this retrospective...</p>

<p>Yes we know. Don't cry &lt;3 ! If you want to have some love too, please comment below.<br>Analysing this post-it's shows team Newtry works just great :) </p>

<p>On top, we can proudly show you that we have more badges! And we both know - you can never have enough badges. </p>

<pre class="wp-block-verse">A million stars up in the sky.
One shines brighter - I can't deny.
A love so precious, a love so true,
a love that comes from me to you.
The angels sing when you are near.
Within your arms I have nothing to fear.
You always know just what to say.
Just talking to you makes my day.
I love you, honey, with all of my heart.
Together forever and never to part.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome back to our latest blog post! We have to talk about refactoring. We wonder if you could refactor your body on a Saturday evening with a delicious cocktail like <a href="https://www.lecker.de/ginger-basil-smash-77786.html">this</a>. If you think we are joking because we give you a receipt for a non-alcoholic cocktail ... then you're totally right! Who needs to refactor his body on a Saturday evening ?!  What we really need on a Saturday evening is a <a href="https://www.acouplecooks.com/whiskey-sour/">Whiskey Sour</a>. Enjoy your cocktail and have fun reading this blog post about refactoring...

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Ok don't be scared, refactoring isn't that bad. We have to remember the main idea of refactoring is to improve the design and structure of software which leads to better code. It is also important to keep in mind that refactoring shouldn't change the behaviour of the software.  This leads to better code and the same behaviour - which sounds very great in our opinion.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

But let's have a look at this week's homework - we should take the first commit of
someone's code and refactor this code until we're happy with it. Or at least we have to refactor until we have 7 commits ... As you can see we have four versions of refactored code. There are many commits to learn from. So feel free to take a look at our four repositories, maybe we can inspire you.

Furthermore, we have some ideas for your future refactoring experience using IntelliJ.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This is only a fraction of the possibilities that you can do to improve your code. Moreover, if your IDE has any other ideas to structure/refactor your code, it will show you warnings.
We hope we were able to give you an insight into refactoring and we wish you a lot of fun refactoring your code! And to come to a rounded end, we have a whiskey wisdom today...

<pre class="wp-block-verse">A man is always looking
To get some free advice
So go and find the fellow
Drinking whiskey over ice

Your friends will tell you one thing
While you're both knocking back a beer
But really, I mean really
Is this the stuff you need to hear

Find a whiskey drinker
He'll tell you how to buy a car
He'll share his whiskey wisdom
About what's a good cigar

A man who drinks good whiskey
Whether neat or over ice
Is the best one you can turn to
When you're looking for advice

He's made it and he knows it
He's not drinking at the pub
He's sitting in a wing back
Drinking whiskey at the club

So, if you're looking for assistance
And you need some good advice
Go get some whiskey wisdom
Sharing whiskey over ice

As always, great work and great blog post :D. I’m in love with the cat and its cute behavior &lt;3 However, coming back to your refactoring, it is quite interesting to see that all of you took different approaches for refactoring the same code snippet. E.g. Oliver to a rather concise approach using comparatively small commits. Jakob or Jona, on the other hand, are working with slightly larger commits. Personally, for projects I favor Oliver’s idea as it gives a more clear overview. Nevertheless, great work! And thanks for the overview of the different shortcuts in IntelliJ 😊

I really enjoyed reading your blog post and looking at the refactored code you did for this week's homework. Supplying the reader with delicious cocktail ideas and a lovely poem at the end is also just great! I hope you keep this till the end. The screenshot with IntelliJ shortcuts is a good idea but maybe you should have provided a link where to find all the shortcuts and for different operating systems. But this is just a minor detail.

<p>Oh hello, I didn't see you coming. But if you are already here, you can take a seat and enjoy our latest blog post. This post is about how to mix new things with already existing parts. Speaking of mixing … we recommend you not only enjoy this post but also this delicious <a href="https://cocktails.de/cocktail-rezepte/sex-beach-cocktail" data-type="URL" data-id="https://cocktails.de/cocktail-rezepte/sex-beach-cocktail">cocktail</a>. Anyway, besides sipping a “few” cocktails, let’s have a look at what we did this week:</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<p>This week’s homework was to refactor our code by using a new Design Pattern. So, we did exactly that, but more about what we did later. What are design patterns and what are they useful for</p>
<p>In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">Wikipedia</a>). So, a design pattern can help you to avoid making typical mistakes or reinventing already existing design structures.</p>
<p>We decided to try the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html">HOC(Higher-Order Components)</a> pattern. This pattern perfectly fits React Native and helps to reuse code when components have pretty similar functions but are not quite the same.</p>
<p>So, let's look at our implementation of this pattern and see how we mixed up our Codebase:&nbsp;</p>
<p>We created a new Component with higher order. This component is a wrapper for any content that is given to this component. In this case, the Component adds a backarrow.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-326" src="https://newtry.ionae.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/added_detailpage-1.png" alt="" width="661" height="883">With this done, we can remove the backarrow from the Productview, move the rest of the return from the Productview into a variable, and call the newly created Detailpage component with this variable as a prop.<img class="alignnone  wp-image-328" src="https://newtry.ionae.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/rest.png" alt="" width="645" height="1067"></p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;By using this pattern, we now have an easy way to add a backarrow to other pages without having to change the structure of these pages. If you want to have a detailed look at what we did, you can check out this <a href="https://github.com/TeamNewtry/Newtry/commit/4f1b0d691a8b8960c5680e5c5fb0866946cb9d67#diff-977c92d0c16b4e81c204fb43844fa958eb51d8a30e86077e82f665c94b9fb6d6L16">commit</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>We hope you have got some inspiration from this blog post, we are looking forward to seeing your comments and as always: Here’s a poem, this time it's about mixing cocktails:</p>
<p></p>

<!-- wp:verse -->
<pre class="wp-block-verse">I am the last barman poet.
I see America drinking the fabulous cocktails I make.
Americans getting stinky on something I stir or shake.
The sex on the beach, the schnapps made from peach,
The Velvet Hammer,
the Alabama Slamma!
I make things with juice and froth: the Pink Squirrel, the 3-Toed Sloth. I make drinks so sweet and snazzy:
The Iced Tea, The Kamikaze, The Orgasm, The Death Spasm,
The Singapore Sling, The Dingaling.
America you’ve just been devoted to every flavor I got.
But if you want to got loaded,
why don’t you just order a shot?
Bar is open.

<p>Hello again to our next blog post.<br>As the title suggests, you don't have to choose between Mojito and Metrics. You can get both. Firstly: <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/147363/the-real-mojito/">here</a> is a good recipe for a Mojito. Secondly: let's take a look at what metrics we used, what we found, and how they improved our code.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://media4.giphy.com/media/VbnUQpnihPSIgIXuZv/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47hm2e0p7l8day660k82rgdifgh3l15bg6bhuu0aki&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g" alt=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We decided, that we want to use <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://deepscan.io/dashboard/#view=project&amp;tid=17820&amp;pid=21155&amp;bid=599182&amp;prid=&amp;subview=overview" target="_blank">Deepscan </a>and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://app.codacy.com/gh/TeamNewtry/Newtry/dashboard" target="_blank">Codacy</a> to add new metrics to our Project. Both tools scan your code, look for issues and give a grade. But why use two tools when they do the same thing?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Actually they are not exactly the same, they have different rules for issues, scan for other important metrics and also use different methods of calculating the grade.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Deepscan </strong>is focused on React and Vue and has this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://deepscan.io/docs/rules/" target="_blank">rule set </a>to evaluate issues. They calculate the grade with this simple rule:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":361,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://newtry.ionae.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Deepscan_rating.png" alt="" class="wp-image-361"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Codacy </strong>is a more general scanner and looks for issues, complexity, duplication and test coverage. The Grade is a&nbsp;weighted average of the available code quality metrics and can be between A and F:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":362,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://newtry.ionae.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Codacy_grading.png" alt="" class="wp-image-362"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now let's take a look at what the scanners found and how we fixed it:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Deepscan found a total of 20 issues. All of them have a low impact and mostly consist of unused imports and variables, so we fixed most of them and now there are just 2 left. If you want to have a look at the fix, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/TeamNewtry/Newtry/commit/4fbb61f6e5ff1cf6ce8bfd4188a5b267d23311e7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":363,"width":673,"height":370,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img src="https://newtry.ionae.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Deepscan_issues.png" alt="" class="wp-image-363" width="673" height="370"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Codacy found more issues than Deepscan, 37 to be precise. These were different issues than in Deepscan. Most of them were actually in our README. So we fixed them too, and now we only have 3 left. The changes can be seen <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/TeamNewtry/Newtry/commit/47dce708d6886148a249448a4bd9a26ef053eb28" target="_blank">here</a>. As already said, Codacy also scans for complexity and duplication. The complexity of our project is very good, none of our files has a complexity of over 10. Also, the duplication is quite good, we only have 7% of duplicate code. So we didn't change anything here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":364,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://newtry.ionae.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Codacy_issues.png" alt="" class="wp-image-364"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a result of our fixes, we now have the best grade in both scanners and of course, we added the grade as badges to our <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/TeamNewtry/Newtry" target="_blank">repo </a>;) </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":368,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://newtry.ionae.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/bages.png" alt="" class="wp-image-368"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So now there is nothing left but to wish you a good week and hope you enjoy this week's poem about Mojito:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:verse -->
<pre class="wp-block-verse"><strong>Herbal Mojito</strong>


Ginger, Lemon, Lime, Ginger, Lemon, Lime
Add some mint now it's Mojito time
Ginger, lemon, lime add some thyme
It's Herbal Mojito time

Ginger, lemon, and some lime
Now add some mint and it's Mojito time
Then make it herbal with some thyme

Don't forget the sage
It's herbal Mojito time

Ginger kills the virus
No more getting sniffly
Herbs make my hair thicker
Rejuvenates my skin making it less crepe
Helps I make me look younger

Ginger, lemon, lime,
Rosemary, Mint, sage, and thyme
It's an herbal mojito time
Mixed with poetic rhyme

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello Newtry-Team,

looks like a good job. Seems like you made a good choice with your tools. And you were able to use them to help and improve your code. 
What I still miss a bit are examples of concrete metrics the tools use and an explanation of them. Also, maybe one or two concrete examples would be helpful in what exactly the two tools differ. 
Otherwise good job, you were able to solve many issues the tools found, great.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello Newtry-Team,

it's commendable, that you use multiple tools to measure the quality of your code. As you stated, the different tools found different weakspots, which you fixed in order to get good grades from your tools. It would be interesting to know, what your grades were prior to the fixing and how much effort it took.

first of all: thank you very much for this week's blogpost!

This blogpost you have succeeded! We liked it very much. It has good explanations in it, the links to the changes, a good "introduction" and a good "conclusion" ;) . You have described the topic well and compactly and also mentioned your (passed) problems. The only thing we missed was an exact explanation of how far (maybe an example) the two tools differ.
We are now even more pleased that you were able to fix a large part of your problems and thus got the best grade for both tools.
Now it's "Final spurt, step on it again!".
We wish you all the best and a successful "finished" project.

<p>Do you know these ugly, not user-friendly installation guides? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ones that require you to download Intellij first - (maybe you already have Intellij installed) - it doesn't matter because in the next step you have to destroy your settings when setting up the backend, only to find that you've messed up the Java version you've installed in your terminal after you freaked out because you need to install Java version 1.8 having a mental breakdown beca...</p>

4. Allow Apps downloaded from your browser to be installed

5. Install the Newtry App</pre>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's it! It's ok, believe me, there is no need to configure backend or npm install, wrong dependencies or stuff like that... That's it :) </p>

<p>Have a great day using our App!<br></p>
